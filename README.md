# Drug-Responses
This study aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the response to drugs in patients with chronic pain, specifically knee osteoarthritis. The researchers extracted features from time series data, including functional connectivity between brain regions, as well as clinical features. These features were used as input to machine learning models, including lasso logistics regression (LLR), gradient boosting machine (GBM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and meta-classifier (MC). The implementation of the mentioned models is done by Python software.
